## 📌 What is JARU?

JARU is a **modern programming language oriented toward IoT development**, designed to be simple, readable, and efficient.  
It runs on a dedicated virtual machine and is especially suited for **embedded systems**, such as **ESP32 and RISC-V platforms**.

Key characteristics include:

- Clean and easy-to-read syntax  
- Dynamic typing  
- Integrated garbage collector  
- Built-in support for GPIO, Wi-Fi, MQTT, and more  

More information and official documentation are available at:

In addition to the language, JARU includes a **full-featured IDE** with visual debugging, intelligent autocompletion, and one-click deployment.  
The IDE itself is **not open source**, but this repository provides a public space for collaboration and feedback.
